## Single-Page Application (SPA)

**Definition**:  
A **Single-Page Application (SPA)** dynamically updates content without reloading the page. SPAs use JavaScript frameworks like **React** to manage routing and UI state in the browser.

###  Benefits of SPA
-  Faster user experience
-  Reduced server load
-  Efficient caching
-  Smooth navigation without reload

##  SPA vs MPA

| Feature              | SPA                              | MPA                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Page Load            | One-time                          | Reload on every page             |
| Navigation Speed     | Fast after initial load           | Slower due to full page reload   |
| Backend Involvement  | Mostly frontend                   | Backend handles views/templates  |
| SEO                  | Needs extra effort (SSR)          | SEO-friendly by default          |
| Examples             | Gmail, Facebook                   | Amazon, Flipkart (classic)       |

##  What is React?

**React** is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces using a **component-based** approach.

### Key Features
- Component-Based Architecture
- Virtual DOM
- JSX (JavaScript + XML)
- One-way Data Binding
- React Hooks
- Router for navigation

---

##  What is Virtual DOM?

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a lightweight copy of the real DOM stored in memory.

### How It Works
1. React builds a virtual representation of UI.
2. On state changes, it compares the new VDOM with the previous one (diffing).
3. Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM (reconciliation).

#  Understanding React State

## What is React State?

React **state** is a built-in object that allows components to create and manage their own data. State represents **dynamic information** that can change over time—like user input, responses from APIs, or UI events—and allows React to re-render the component whenever that data changes.

---

## Why Use State?

Without state, components would be static. With state, you can:
- Track user interactions (e.g., input fields, button clicks)
- Manage API data (e.g., fetched results)
- Control conditional rendering (e.g., modals, toggles)

---

## How to Use State

React provides the `useState()` hook in functional components.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
Explanation
count is the state variable.

setCount is the function to update the state.

useState(0) initializes count to 0.

### Rules of State
 You can use multiple useState() hooks.

 Never update state directly (e.g., count = count + 1 is invalid).

 State updates are asynchronous—they do not happen instantly.

 Changing state triggers a re-render.

### Common Pitfalls
State doesn't update immediately: React batches updates for performance.

Overusing state: Not all data needs to be in state. Only dynamic or user-driven data should be.

State scope: State in one component isn’t accessible in another unless passed via props or managed globally.

### When to Use State vs Props?
Feature	state	props
Mutability	Mutable (can change)	Immutable (read-only)
Ownership	Controlled by the component	Passed from parent component
Purpose	Internal data & interactivity	External configuration/data
##  Project: My First React App
##  Difference Between `state` and `props` in React

| Aspect              | `state`                                      | `props`                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Mutability**       | Mutable – can be changed using `setState` or `useState()` | Immutable – cannot be changed by the component receiving them |
| **Ownership**        | Managed within the component                 | Passed from parent to child component        |
| **Purpose**          | For internal data and UI logic               | For configuration and communication between components |
| **Usage**            | Declared with `useState()` (functional) or in `this.state` (class) | Passed via attributes when using the component |
| **Updatability**     | Can be updated based on user interaction or app logic | Cannot be modified by the receiving component |
| **Component Type**   | Used in both functional and class components | Used in all component types                  |
| **Triggers Re-render?** | Yes, when changed via `setState` or `useState` | Yes, when parent re-renders with new values  |

This is a basic React app built using `create-react-app`.

### 🔨 What Was Done:
-  Installed Node.js & npm
-  Created app using `npx create-react-app myfirstreact`
-  Opened in VS Code
-  Edited `App.js` to show a welcome message
-  Ran the React development server

---

##  Why Component Lifecycle is Needed

React components go through a lifecycle from creation to destruction. The **lifecycle methods** provide hooks that allow developers to:

- Fetch data from APIs
- Set up subscriptions or timers
- Perform cleanup before components are removed
- Handle errors gracefully
- Optimize performance and rendering

These hooks give developers **fine-grained control** over what happens and when in the life of a component.

---

##  Benefits of Using Lifecycle Methods

-  **Data Initialization**: Fetch or prepare data before rendering (`componentDidMount`)
-  **Update Control**: Respond to props or state changes (`componentDidUpdate`)
-  **Cleanup**: Avoid memory leaks by cleaning up timers, listeners (`componentWillUnmount`)
-  **Error Handling**: Catch and display component errors gracefully (`componentDidCatch`)
-  **Performance Tuning**: Prevent unnecessary rendering (`shouldComponentUpdate`)

---

##  Common Lifecycle Hook Methods (Class Components)

| Phase              | Method                   | Description |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Mounting**       | `constructor()`          | Initialize state and bind methods |
|                    | `componentDidMount()`    | Called after component is inserted into the DOM |
| **Updating**       | `shouldComponentUpdate()`| Determines if re-rendering is necessary |
|                    | `componentDidUpdate()`   | Runs after component updates in the DOM |
| **Unmounting**     | `componentWillUnmount()` | Cleanup before component is removed |
| **Error Handling** | `componentDidCatch()`    | Catch JavaScript errors in children |

#  React Router: Concepts & Usage

##  Why Do We Need React Router?

React is a Single Page Application (SPA) library, meaning it loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the page. However, SPAs still need navigation between views (e.g., Home → About → Profile).

###  Problems without React Router:
- Reloading the whole app manually
- Difficult manual state and URL management
- Lack of deep linking (copy-pasteable URLs)

###  Benefits of React Router:
- Enables **multi-view navigation** in SPAs
- Preserves **application state** between navigations
- Uses **URL history API** for clean navigation
- Allows **deep linking** to specific content
- Supports **dynamic routing** (e.g., `/users/:id`)

---

##  React Router Components

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `<BrowserRouter>` | Wraps your application to enable routing using the browser’s History API |
| `<Routes>`        | Replaces older `<Switch>`; renders the first matching child `<Route>` |
| `<Route>`         | Defines a path and the component to render |
| `<Link>`          | Navigates to another route without reloading the page |
| `<NavLink>`       | Like `<Link>`, but adds styling when link is active |
| `<useParams>`     | A hook to access URL parameters |
| `<useNavigate>`   | A hook to programmatically navigate |

# React Q&A: Props, State, and ReactDOM

##  Q1: What are Props in React?

** Answer:**

Props (short for "properties") are read-only attributes used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They allow components to be dynamic and reusable.

###  Example:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
<Welcome name="Elisa" />

##  Q2: What are Default Props in React??
** Answer:**

Default Props are values a React component uses if no specific props are provided by the parent component. They act as fallback values to prevent undefined errors.
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

Welcome.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest"
};

## Q3: What is the difference between State and Props in React?
** Answer:**

##  Difference Between Props and State in React

| Feature            | Props                             | State                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Passed from parent component       | Managed within the component           |
| **Mutability**     | Immutable (read-only)              | Mutable (can be changed)               |
| **Purpose**        | Configure components with external data | Track internal, dynamic data     |
| **Access**         | `props.propertyName`               | `this.state` (class) / `useState()` (function) |
| **Who Controls It**| Parent component                   | Component itself                       |
| **Modifiable By**  | Cannot be modified by the component| Can be updated using `setState()` or `useState()` |
| **Usage Scenario** | Used for passing data between components | Used for handling UI behavior and data changes |

## Q4: What is ReactDOM.render()?
**Answer:**

ReactDOM.render() is a method used to render React elements or components into the actual DOM (Document Object Model).

It serves as the entry point of a React application to mount the root component to a DOM node.

🔹 Syntax:
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
🔹 Explanation:
<App /> is the component being rendered.

document.getElementById('root') points to the HTML element where the component is injected.

It is typically used in index.js of a React app.

##  Types of Routers in React Router

1. **BrowserRouter**  
   - Uses the HTML5 History API  
   - Clean URLs (no `#`)  
   - Most commonly used  

2. **HashRouter**  
   - Uses the hash portion of the URL (`/#/about`)  
   - Useful when server doesn't support history API  

3. **MemoryRouter**  
   - Keeps navigation history in memory (not reflected in the URL)  
   - Useful for testing or non-browser environments  

---

##  Parameter Passing via URL

You can pass dynamic data in the URL using route parameters.

###  Define Route with Params
```jsx
<Route path="/user/:userId" element={<UserDetails />} />

##  Sequence of Steps in Rendering a Class Component

```text
1. constructor()
2. render()
3. componentDidMount()
(when state/props change)
4. shouldComponentUpdate()

 8. Types of Components
1️ Function Component
Defined using a simple function.

Can use React Hooks like useState, useEffect.
function Welcome() {
  return <h2>Hello from Function Component!</h2>;
}
 Preferred in modern React for simplicity.

2️ Class Component
Defined using ES6 class syntax.

Can use state and lifecycle methods.
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hello from Class Component!</h2>;
  }
}
 Useful when lifecycle methods or complex logic is needed.

 Constructor in Class Component
Used to initialize state or bind methods.
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    name: 'React Learner'
  };
}
 Always call super(props) before using this.

 render() Function
All class components must have a render() function that returns JSX.
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {this.state.name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

 9. Usage Example in App.js
import React from 'react';
import Welcome from './Welcome';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
